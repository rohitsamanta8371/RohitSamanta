                    Learning in a Changing World has brought on a number of positive learning experiences.
                     I have started my learning journey with holding my parent's hand in 2003 when I was 
                     2.5 years old.
                     From begining there was many ups and downs but I had two strong weapon equipped in me 
                     which are down to earth behaviour and my never give up attitude. <br>

                    I have started schooling from Burdwan Municipal High School. In my school days i was a 
                    average student. In my early days I was a little bit introvert that I don't like talk too 
                    much. At that time my teachers could hardly recognize me. After promoted to the high school
                     I have joined the school BasketBall team, In one year of training I got selected to the West
                     Bengal Junior BasketBall Team. After Coming from the tour suddenly I became popular in the school,
                     then every teacher could recognise me not only for my good behaviour but also for my skills.
                     From my childhood I was in love with solving the problems in Math. I had appeared in my secondary
                     board exam in the year 2016 and got 97 in Math & the total of 84% in the examination. And after 
                     2 years in 2018 I have passed my higher secondary examination with 94 in Math and my total was
                     77.80%. Thus began my college journey.<br>

                    I am pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Haldia Institute of Technology.
                    Like other guys I was also very curious in my 1<sup>st</sup> year of my college days.
                    Now I am in 3<sup>rd</sup> year. In my 1<sup>st</sup> year I have started basics programming
                    and the starting was not really hard for me as I was familiar with it from my high school.
                    I have learnt C and Python Language in my 1<sup>st</sup> year of college days. In my 
                    2<sup>nd</sup> year I have started working on Web Development using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 
                    Now at the last of my 3<sup>rd</sup> year I know C, C++, Python, Java programming languages.<br>
